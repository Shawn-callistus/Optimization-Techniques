## Design and Analysis of Algorithms
* ### Needleman Wunsch Algorithm

* ### Implementation of Neural networks using Keras on the given dataset along with the following optimisations algorithms
   *  ####  Ant Colony Optimisation
         Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a powerful algorithm for solving complex optimization problems. It is inspired by the way ants find the shortest path between their nest and a food source by depositing and following pheromone trails. Using Python, adjust parameters like the number of ants, pheromone evaporation rate, and iteration count.
      
   *   #### Paricle Swarm Optimisation
       Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a heuristic optimization algorithm that mimics the movement of particles in a search space to find optimal solutions.Using Python, customize the initialization strategy for particle positions and velocities and adjust parameters like swarm size, velocity coefficients, and iteration count.
       
   *  #### Cultural Algorithm
        Cultural Algorithms combine the concepts of evolutionary algorithms and cultural evolution to enhance optimization performance. Using Python, customize the cultural algorithm's knowledge sources and beliefs
   *  #### Genetic Algorithm
         Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are powerful optimization algorithms that mimic the process of natural evolution such as Crossover, Mutation to find optimal solutions. Using Python, define the fitness function and adjust the parameters like
      population size, crossover rate, mutation rate, and iteration count.
