## Design and Analysis of Algorithms
* ### Needleman Wunsch Algorithm

* ### Implementation of Neural networks using Keras on the given dataset along with the following optimisations algorithms
   *  ####  Ant Colony Optimisation
         Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a powerful algorithm for solving complex optimization problems. It is inspired by the way ants find the shortest path between their nest and a food source by depositing and following pheromone trails. 
   *   #### Paricle Swarm Optimisation
       Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a heuristic optimization algorithm that mimics the movement of particles in a search space to find optimal solutions.
       
   *  #### Cultural Algorithm
        Cultural Algorithms combine the concepts of evolutionary algorithms and cultural evolution to enhance optimization performance.
   *    Genetic Algorithm
