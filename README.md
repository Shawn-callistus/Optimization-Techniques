## Design and Analysis of Algorithms
* ### Needleman Wunsch Algorithm

* ### Implementation of Neural networks using Keras on the given dataset along with the following optimisations algorithms
   *    Ant Colony Optimisation
   **    It is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the behavior of ants. It is commonly used to solve combinatorial optimization problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the job shop scheduling problem, the vehicle routing problem, and the Knapsack problem.
