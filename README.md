## Design and Analysis of Algorithms
* ### Needleman Wunsch Algorithm

* ### Implementation of Neural networks using Keras on the given dataset along with the following optimisations algorithms
   *  ####  Ant Colony Optimisation
         Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a powerful algorithm for solving complex optimization problems. It is inspired by the way ants find the shortest path between their nest and a food source by depositing and following pheromone trails. This repository provides a Python implementation of the ACO algorithm, which can be adapted for various optimization tasks.
